# parallel_utilities
Various utility codes that you'd rather not write repetitively when designing parallel algorithms.

# Instructions

For adding a new program, make sure you follow these guidelines:
* Place your code in an appropriately named file/folder in this repo.
* Describe your contribution below in the README so that other people can easily find your work.

# Code

Descriptions about code go here:

* `pblas_matmul.cpp` :: A simple C++ program for mutliplying two matrices using PBLAS and BLACS (MPI).
* `simple_scalapack_lu_decomposition.cpp` :: A simple C++ program for calculating distributed LU decomposition using ScaLAPACK.
* `hpc_lecture` :: Code from Yokota Sensei's lecture 'HPC for Scientific Computing'. Contains many introductory codes using MPI, openMP, CUDA, etc.
